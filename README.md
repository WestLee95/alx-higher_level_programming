This marks the beginning of Python.
Be careful it slithers a lot.

This assignment helps us understand OOP {Object Oriented Programming}.

TASK 0: Talks of writing an empty class that defines a rectangle.

TASK 1: A Python class, Rectangle, with private attributes width and height.

TASK 2: The same as TASK 1 then added public instances of Area and Perimeter.
TASK 3: TASK 2 - print symbol to represent the rectangle visually.

TASK 5: TASK 4 - Print the message Bye rectangle... when an instance is deleted.
TASK 6: TASK 5 - An instance number of instances is intro.d and initialized to 0,
        Increments during each new instance instantiation then
        Decrements during each instance deletion.
TASK 7: TASK 6 - the print symbol is initialized to # and can be any type.
TASK 8: TASK 7 - a static method intro.d that returns the biggest rectangle based on the area.
TASK 9: TASK 8 - a class method that returns a square rectangle instance.

Other than these tasks this repo also contains several python projects and tasks and also
	key high level C project. Such as those pertaking Algorithims.
	Handling Big O Notation and later to come Data Structures.
